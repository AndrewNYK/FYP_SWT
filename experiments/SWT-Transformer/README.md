# Reference Paper and Details
Reference Github Repo for SWT Transformer implemenetation
https://github.com/LyesSaadSaoud/House_transformer/blob/main/Transformers_Houses1to5_5min.py

Github Repository links to: 
T.-Y. Kim and S.-B. Cho, ‘‘Predicting residential energy consumption using CNN–LSTM neural networks,’’

File under SWT Research Papers/ folder:
2019_Energy_TYK


Dataset: Individual Household Electric Power Consumption
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Initially use as comparison, but the paper that use SWT uses another dataset: UK Dale

# Correction
Found Paper for SWT transformer corresponding to github implementation
File under SWT Research Papers/ folder:
Household_Energy_Consumption_Prediction_Using_the_Stationary_Wavelet_Transform_and_Transformers.pdf

Dataset: UK Dale
https://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/DC/cgi-bin/edc_search.pl/?WantComp=138 

# Steps
All python files and ipynb files use to test Github implementation

**no "-pytorch" files**
tensorflow implementation from original github code but modified due to many errors found

**"-pytorch" files**
Pytorch implementation testing for equivalent conversion

File that has correct conversion:
Transformer_Houses1to5_5min-pytorch.ipynb
